; Work in progress.
; This file will cross-assemble an original version of the "Improved"
; ZX81 ROM.  The file can be modified to change the behaviour of the ROM
; when used in emulators although there is no spare space available.
;
; The documentation is incomplete and if you can find a copy
; of "The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly" then many routines
; such as POINTERS and most of the mathematical routines are
; similar and often identical.
;
; I've used the labels from the above book in this file and also
; some from the more elusive Complete ZX81 ROM Disassembly
; by the same publishers, Melbourne House.

;** Part 1. RESTART ROUTINES AND TABLES **
;*****************************************

; -----------
; THE 'START'
; -----------
; All Z80 chips start at location zero.
; At start-up the Interrupt Mode is 0, ZX computers use Interrupt Mode 1.
; Interrupts are disabled .

;; START
0000    OUT     ($FD),A         ; Turn off the NMI generator if this ROM is
                                ; running in ZX81 hardware. This does nothing
                                ; if this ROM is running within an upgraded
                                ; ZX80.
        LD      BC,$7FFF        ; Set BC to the top of possible RAM.
                                ; The higher unpopulated addresses are used for
                                ; video generation.
        JP      L03CB           ; Jump forward to RAM-CHECK.

; -------------------
; THE 'ERROR' RESTART
; -------------------
; The error restart deals immediately with an error. ZX computers execute the
; same code in runtime as when checking syntax. If the error occurred while
; running a program then a brief report is produced. If the error occurred
; while entering a BASIC line or in input etc., then the error marker indicates
; the exact point at which the error lies.

;; ERROR-1
0008    LD      HL,($4016)      ; fetch character address from CH_ADD.
        LD      ($4018),HL      ; and set the error pointer X_PTR.
        JR      L0056           ; forward to continue at ERROR-2.

; -------------------------------
; THE 'PRINT A CHARACTER' RESTART
; -------------------------------
; This restart prints the character in the accumulator using the alternate
; register set so there is no requirement to save the main registers.
; There is sufficient room available to separate a space (zero) from other
; characters as leading spaces need not be considered with a space.

;; PRINT-A
0010    AND     A               ; test for zero - space.
        JP      NZ,L07F1        ; jump forward if not to PRINT-CH.

        JP      L07F5           ; jump forward to PRINT-SP.

; ---------------------------------
; THE 'COLLECT A CHARACTER' RESTART
; ---------------------------------
; The character addressed by the system variable CH_ADD is fetched and if it
; is a non-space, non-cursor character it is returned else CH_ADD is
; incremented and the new addressed character tested until it is not a space.

;; GET-CHAR
0018    LD      HL,($4016)      ; set HL to character address CH_ADD.
        LD      A,(HL)          ; fetch addressed character to A.

;; TEST-SP
001C    AND     A               ; test for space.
        RET     NZ              ; return if not a space

        NOP                     ; else trickle through
        NOP                     ; to the next routine.

; ------------------------------------
; THE 'COLLECT NEXT CHARACTER' RESTART
; ------------------------------------
; The character address in incremented and the new addressed character is
; returned if not a space, or cursor, else the process is repeated.

;; NEXT-CHAR
0020    CALL    L0049           ; routine CH-ADD+1 gets next immediate
                                ; character.

; ---------------------------------------
; THE 'FLOATING POINT CALCULATOR' RESTART
; ---------------------------------------
; this restart jumps to the recursive floating-point calculator.
; the ZX81's internal, FORTH-like, stack-based language.
;
; In the five remaining bytes there is, appropriately, enough room for the
; end-calc literal - the instruction which exits the calculator.

;; FP-CALC
0028    JP      L199D           ; jump immediately to the CALCULATE routine.

;; end-calc

        RET                     ; return.


; -----------------------------
; THE 'MAKE BC SPACES'  RESTART
; -----------------------------
; This restart is used eight times to create, in workspace, the number of
; spaces passed in the BC register.

;; BC-SPACES
0030    PUSH    BC              ; push number of spaces on stack.
        LD      HL,($4014)      ; fetch edit line location from E_LINE.
        PUSH    HL              ; save this value on stack.
        JP      L1488           ; jump forward to continue at RESERVE.

; -----------------------
; THE 'INTERRUPT' RESTART
; -----------------------
;   The Mode 1 Interrupt routine is concerned solely with generating the central
;   television picture.
;   On the ZX81 interrupts are enabled only during the interrupt routine,
;   although the interrupt
;   This Interrupt Service Routine automatically disables interrupts at the
;   outset and the last interrupt in a cascade exits before the interrupts are
;   enabled.
;   There is no DI instruction in the ZX81 ROM.
;   An maskable interrupt is triggered when bit 6 of the Z80's Refresh register
;   changes from set to reset.
;   The Z80 will always be executing a HALT (NEWLINE) when the interrupt occurs.
;   A HALT instruction repeatedly executes NOPS but the seven lower bits
;   of the Refresh register are incremented each time as they are when any
;   simple instruction is executed. (The lower 7 bits are incremented twice for
;   a prefixed instruction)
;   This is controlled by the Sinclair Computer Logic Chip - manufactured from
;   a Ferranti Uncommitted Logic Array.
;
;   When a Mode 1 Interrupt occurs the Program Counter, which is the address in
;   the upper echo display following the NEWLINE/HALT instruction, goes on the
;   machine stack.  193 interrupts are required to generate the last part of
;   the 56th border line and then the 192 lines of the central TV picture and,
;   although each interrupt interrupts the previous one, there are no stack
;   problems as the 'return address' is discarded each time.
;
;   The scan line counter in C counts down from 8 to 1 within the generation of
;   each text line. For the first interrupt in a cascade the initial value of
;   C is set to 1 for the last border line.
;   Timing is of the utmost importance as the RH border, horizontal retrace
;   and LH border are mostly generated in the 58 clock cycles this routine
;   takes .

;; INTERRUPT
0038    DEC     C               ; (4)  decrement C - the scan line counter.
        JP      NZ,L0045        ; (10/10) JUMP forward if not zero to SCAN-LINE

        POP     HL              ; (10) point to start of next row in display
                                ;      file.

        DEC     B               ; (4)  decrement the row counter. (4)

                                ;      Note. LD C,$08 is 7 clock cycles which
                                ;      is way too fast.

        JP      (HL)            ; (4) jump to the echo display file in upper

                                ;     will be encountered before R reaches $FF.
                                ;     It is however the transition from $FF to
                                ;     $80 that triggers the next interrupt.
                                ;     [ The Refresh register is now $DF ]

;; SCAN-LINE
0045    POP     DE              ; (10) discard the address after NEWLINE as the
                                ;      same text line has to be done again

        JR      L0041           ; (12) back to WAIT-INT

;   Note. that a computer with less than 4K or RAM will have a collapsed
;   display file and the above mechanism deals with both types of display.
;
;   With a full display, the 32 characters in the line are treated as NOPS
;   and the Refresh register rises from $E0 to $FF and, at the next instruction
;   - HALT, the interrupt occurs.
;   With a collapsed display and an initial NEWLINE/HALT, it is the NOPs
;   generated by the HALT that cause the Refresh value to rise from $E0 to $FF,
;   triggering an Interrupt on the next transition.
;   This works happily for all display lines between these extremes and the
;   generation of the 32 character, 1 pixel high, line will always take 128
;   clock cycles.

; ---------------------------------
; THE 'INCREMENT CH-ADD' SUBROUTINE
; ---------------------------------
; This is the subroutine that increments the character address system variable
; and returns if it is not the cursor character. The ZX81 has an actual
; character at the cursor position rather than a pointer system variable
; as is the case with prior and subsequent ZX computers.

;; CH-ADD+1

;; TEMP-PTR1

;; TEMP-PTR2

        LD      A,(HL)          ; fetch the character.
        CP      $7F             ; compare to cursor character.
        RET     NZ              ; return if not the cursor.

        JR      L004C           ; back for next character to TEMP-PTR1.

; --------------------
; THE 'ERROR-2' BRANCH
; --------------------
; This is a continuation of the error restart.
; If the error occurred in runtime then the error stack pointer will probably
; lead to an error report being printed unless it occurred during input.
; If the error occurred when checking syntax then the error stack pointer
; will be an editing routine and the position of the error will be shown
; when the lower screen is reprinted.

                                ; anymore.

; ------------------------------------
; THE 'NON MASKABLE INTERRUPT' ROUTINE
; ------------------------------------
;   Jim Westwood's technical dodge using Non-Maskable Interrupts solved the
;   flicker problem of the ZX80 and gave the ZX81 a multi-tasking SLOW mode
;   with a steady display.  Note that the AF' register is reserved for this
;   function and its interaction with the display routines.  When counting
;   TV lines, the NMI makes no use of the main registers.
;   The circuitry for the NMI generator is contained within the SCL (Sinclair
;   Computer Logic) chip.
;   ( It takes 32 clock cycles while incrementing towards zero ).

; THE 'CLEAR PRINTER BUFFER' SUBROUTINE
; -------------------------------------
; This subroutine sets 32 bytes of the printer buffer to zero (space) and
; the 33rd character is set to a NEWLINE.
; This occurs after the printer buffer is sent to the printer but in addition
; after the 24 lines of the screen are sent to the printer.
; Note. This is a logic error as the last operation does not involve the
; buffer at all. Logically one should be able to use
; 10 LPRINT "HELLO ";
; 20 COPY
; 30 LPRINT ; "WORLD"
; and expect to see the entire greeting emerge from the printer.
; Surprisingly this logic error was never discovered and although one can argue
; if the above is a bug, the repetition of this error on the Spectrum was most
; definitely a bug.
; Since the printer buffer is fixed at the end of the system variables, and
; the print position is in the range $3C - $5C, then bit 7 of the system
; variable is set to show the buffer is empty and automatically reset when
; the variable is updated with any print position - neat.

; invoked from DEC-TO-FP and PRINT-FP.
; e.g. 2.3E4 is 23000.
; This subroutine evaluates xEm where m is a positive or negative integer.
; At a simple level x is multiplied by ten for every unit of m.
; If the decimal exponent m is negative then x is divided by ten for each unit.
; A short-cut is taken if the exponent is greater than seven and in this
; case the exponent is reduced by seven and the value is multiplied or divided
; by ten million.
; Note. for the ZX Spectrum an even cleverer method was adopted which involved
; shifting the bits out of the exponent so the result was achieved with six
; shifts at most. The routine below had to be completely re-written mostly
; in Z80 machine code.
; Although no longer operable, the calculator literal was retained for old
; times sake, the routine being invoked directly from a machine code CALL.
;
; On entry in the ZX81, m, the exponent, is the 'last value', and the
; floating-point decimal mantissa is beneath it.

; ---------------------------------
; offset $86: 'series-06'
; offset $88: 'series-08'
; offset $8C: 'series-0C'
; The ZX81 uses Chebyshev polynomials to generate approximations for
; SIN, ATN, LN and EXP. These are named after the Russian mathematician
; Pafnuty Chebyshev, born in 1821, who did much pioneering work on numerical
; series. As far as calculators are concerned, Chebyshev polynomials have an
; advantage over other series, for example the Taylor series, as they can
; reach an approximation in just six iterations for SIN, eight for EXP and
; twelve for LN and ATN. The mechanics of the routine are interesting but
; for full treatment of how these are generated with demonstrations in
; Sinclair BASIC see "The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly" by Dr Ian Logan
; and Dr Frank O'Hara, published 1983 by Melbourne House.

; String comparisons are a little different in that the eql/neql carry flag
; from the 2nd RRCA is, as before, fed into the first of the end tests but
; along the way it gets modified by the comparison process. The result on the
; stack always starts off as zero and the carry fed in determines if NOT is
; applied to it. So the only time the greater-0 test is applied is if the
; stack holds zero which is not very efficient as the test will always yield
; zero. The most likely explanation is that there were once separate end tests
; for numbers and strings.

; --------------------------------
; THE 'NATURAL LOGARITHM' FUNCTION
; --------------------------------
; (offset $22: 'ln')
;   Like the ZX81 itself, 'natural' logarithms came from Scotland.
;   They were devised in 1614 by well-traveled Scotsman John Napier who noted
;   "Nothing doth more molest and hinder calculators than the multiplications,
;    divisions, square and cubical extractions of great numbers".
;
;   Napier's logarithms enabled the above operations to be accomplished by
;   simple addition and subtraction simplifying the navigational and
;   astronomical calculations which beset his age.
;   Napier's logarithms were quickly overtaken by logarithms to the base 10
;   devised, in conjunction with Napier, by Henry Briggs a Cambridge-educated
;   professor of Geometry at Oxford University. These simplified the layout
;   of the tables enabling humans to easily scale calculations.
;
;   It is only recently with the introduction of pocket calculators and
;   computers like the ZX81 that natural logarithms are once more at the fore,
;   although some computers retain logarithms to the base ten.
;   'Natural' logarithms are powers to the base 'e', which like 'pi' is a
;   naturally occurring number in branches of mathematics.
;   Like 'pi' also, 'e' is an irrational number and starts 2.718281828...
;
;   The tabular use of logarithms was that to multiply two numbers one looked
;   up their two logarithms in the tables, added them together and then looked
;   for the result in a table of antilogarithms to give the desired product.
;
;   The EXP function is the BASIC equivalent of a calculator's 'antiln' function
;   and by picking any two numbers, 1.72 and 6.89 say,
;     10 PRINT EXP ( LN 1.72 + LN 6.89 )
;   will give just the same result as
;     20 PRINT 1.72 * 6.89.
;   Division is accomplished by subtracting the two logs.
;
;   Napier also mentioned "square and cubicle extractions".
;   To raise a number to the power 3, find its 'ln', multiply by 3 and find the
;   'antiln'.  e.g. PRINT EXP( LN 4 * 3 )  gives 64.
;   Similarly to find the n'th root divide the logarithm by 'n'.
;   The ZX81 ROM used PRINT EXP ( LN 9 / 2 ) to find the square root of the
;   number 9. The Napieran square root function is just a special case of
;   the 'to_power' function. A cube root or indeed any root/power would be just
;   as simple.

;   First test that the argument to LN is a positive, non-zero number.

; -----------------------------
; THE 'TRIGONOMETRIC' FUNCTIONS
; -----------------------------
;   Trigonometry is rocket science. It is also used by carpenters and pyramid
;   builders.
;   Some uses can be quite abstract but the principles can be seen in simple
;   right-angled triangles. Triangles have some special properties -
;
;   1) The sum of the three angles is always PI radians (180 degrees).
;      Very helpful if you know two angles and wish to find the third.
;   2) In any right-angled triangle the sum of the squares of the two shorter
;      sides is equal to the square of the longest side opposite the right-angle.
;      Very useful if you know the length of two sides and wish to know the
;      length of the third side.
;   3) Functions sine, cosine and tangent enable one to calculate the length
;      of an unknown side when the length of one other side and an angle is
;      known.
;   4) Functions arcsin, arccosine and arctan enable one to calculate an unknown
;      angle when the length of two of the sides is known.

; --------------------------------
; THE 'REDUCE ARGUMENT' SUBROUTINE
; --------------------------------
; (offset $35: 'get-argt')
;
;   This routine performs two functions on the angle, in radians, that forms
;   the argument to the sine and cosine functions.
;   First it ensures that the angle 'wraps round'. That if a ship turns through
;   an angle of, say, 3*PI radians (540 degrees) then the net effect is to turn
;   through an angle of PI radians (180 degrees).
;   Secondly it converts the angle in radians to a fraction of a right angle,
;   depending within which quadrant the angle lies, with the periodicity
;   resembling that of the desired sine value.
;   The result lies in the range -1 to +1.

;
;   The cosine of angle x is the adjacent side (a) divided by the hypotenuse 1.
;   However if we examine angle y then a/h is the sine of that angle.
;   Since angle x plus angle y equals a right-angle, we can find angle y by
;   subtracting angle x from pi/2.
;   However it's just as easy to reduce the argument first and subtract the
;   reduced argument from the value 1 (a reduced right-angle).
;   It's even easier to subtract 1 from the angle and rectify the sign.
;   In fact, after reducing the argument, the absolute value of the argument
;   is used and rectified using the test result stored in mem-0 by 'get-argt'
;   for that purpose.

; THE 'ARCSIN' FUNCTION
; ---------------------
; (Offset $1F: 'asn')
;   The inverse sine function with result in radians.
;   Derived from arctan function above.

;
;   e.g. We know the opposite side (x) and hypotenuse (1)
;   and we wish to find angle a in radians.
;   We can derive length y by Pythagoras and then use ATN instead.
;   Since y*y + x*x = 1*1 (Pythagoras Theorem) then
;   y=sqr(1-x*x)                         - no need to multiply 1 by itself.
;   So, asn(a) = atn(x/y)
;   or more fully,
;   asn(a) = atn(x/sqr(1-x*x))

;   Close but no cigar.

;   While PRINT ATN (x/SQR (1-x*x)) gives the same results as PRINT ASN x,
;   it leads to division by zero when x is 1 or -1.
;   To overcome this, 1 is added to y giving half the required angle and the
;   result is then doubled.
;   That is, PRINT ATN (x/(SQR (1-x*x) +1)) *2

; (Offset $20: 'acs')
;   The inverse cosine function with the result in radians.
;   Error A unless the argument is between -1 and +1.
;   Result in range 0 to pi.
;   Derived from asn above which is in turn derived from the preceding atn. It
;   could have been derived directly from atn using acs(x) = atn(sqr(1-x*x)/x).
;   However, as sine and cosine are horizontal translations of each other,
;   uses acs(x) = pi/2 - asn(x)

;   e.g. the arccosine of a known x value will give the required angle b in
;   radians.
;   We know, from above, how to calculate the angle a using asn(x).
;   Since the three angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees, or pi radians,
;   and the largest angle in this case is a right-angle (pi/2 radians), then
;   we can calculate angle b as pi/2 (both angles) minus asn(x) (angle a).
